Project Description:
       Our user friendly, self led workout routine website helps gym goers easily organize their weekly fitness schedule. This website has a simple, aesthetically pleasing design and an easily operated system to save personal workout routine data. The user starts by registering for an account or signing into an existing account. They can select exercises for a specific day of the week to accomplish their fitness goals such increasing muscle mass or improving cardio. There are a wide variety of types of workouts on this site that target different muscle groups with varying repetition frequencies. This lets the user personalize their fitness journey. The home page displays the workout routines that apply to their fitness goals. The user can also remove or edit exercises from the schedule if desired. These workout plans are a week by week routine so it can be managed easily for the user. Details of each workout are given which includes the type of exercise, duration/repetitions, and description of exercise. You can modify your workout plan to get new routines for a new week. They can change their password and their account data will remain. Finally, selecting Logout saves the users data for the next time they log in and redirects them to the login page.
